                    <p class="boxed">I have always been very curious about how things work in general, reason why I tend to take apart my computers, put them back together (sometimes I break them), set up sound systems, and in general I believe anyone can do anything as long as they want to learn, yes I am the kind of person that reads the manual.</p>

                    <p class="boxed">I decided to go back to school, I wanted a challenge and a change. While taking classes at NYU a programming professor told me I should look into coding, It seemed like it came easy to me, and it did!, I really enjoyed coding, I took an MIT computer science class and after that all I wanted to do was to code, so I started teaching my self how to do it.</p>

                    <p class="boxed">Finally, I quit my job, and dedicated all my time to learn to code and become great at it, after a while I started learning more and more, I have participated in hackathons and almost won Google's Devfest 2016 (3rd place... so close). Recently I have been teaching code at a High school in Brooklyn and learning to combine code with design, I am a full stack web developer and want to be part of a company that feels the same way about technology as I do.</p>
                    
                    <p class="boxed yellow">
                        I believe every kid should learn to code at an early age since they are the ones who are going to mold the future of humanity.
